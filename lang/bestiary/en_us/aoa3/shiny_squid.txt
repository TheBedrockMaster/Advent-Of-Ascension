An exceptionally rare variant of the standard Squid, the Shiny Squid is a magical anomaly with very little public knowledge.
It appears to share some similarities with the Glow Squid in that they are both magically imbued, but in seemingly different ways.

Because of their incredibly rarity, not much is known about Shiny Squid, but it is thought that simply encountering one would help with understanding the fundamentals of the aquatic world.
